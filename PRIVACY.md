# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 5 December 2025

Hanzi Dictionary & Strokes (the “App”) is published by the Bishun Art team (“we”, “us”). This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the controls you have when using the App and any related services (for example beta tests, support email, or feedback forms). The App is designed for non-native learners who want to search HSK characters, review stroke orders, and practice handwriting.

## Data We Collect

We keep data collection to the absolute minimum required to operate and improve the App.

1. **On-device study data.** Stroke practice history, bookmarks, and other preferences are stored only on your device. We do not receive or sync this information unless you explicitly share it with us.
2. **Diagnostics and crash reports.** Google Play may automatically provide us with anonymized, aggregated diagnostics such as crash logs and ANR reports so that we can fix stability issues. These reports do not contain personally identifying information.
3. **Communication data.** If you contact us (for example by emailing `qq260316514@qq.com`), we collect the contact details and message content you submit so we can respond to your request.

The App currently does **not** require an account or login, and we do not collect personal identifiers, payment details, or tracking information.

## How We Use Information

Collected data is used solely to:

- Provide the App’s core features (HSK Level 1 lessons, stroke animations, and dictionary lookups).
- Diagnose crashes and performance issues.
- Respond to support requests and manage beta tests.
- Plan future updates such as paid unlocks for higher HSK levels.

We do not sell or rent your information.

## Data Sharing

We may share limited data only in the following situations:

- **Service providers.** Google Play and related Google services process diagnostics, delivery, and install statistics on our behalf.
- **Legal compliance.** We may disclose information if required to comply with applicable laws or to protect our rights.
- **Aggregated statistics.** We may share anonymized, aggregated usage trends that cannot identify you.

## Data Retention

On-device study data remains on your device until you delete the App or clear the App data. Emails and crash logs are retained only as long as necessary to handle the associated request or improve stability.

## Data Security

We rely on Google Play’s distribution infrastructure and industry-standard safeguards to protect diagnostics data. Communications sent to us are stored on password-protected systems. Because no system is completely secure, we encourage you not to include sensitive information in support emails.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is intended for learners aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will remove it.

## Your Choices

- You can delete local study data at any time via the App or by uninstalling it.
- If you opt out of sharing diagnostics in Google Play or your device settings, we will no longer receive crash logs tied to your device.
- You can request deletion of prior communications by emailing us.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as the App evolves. Material changes will be communicated through App updates or our website. Continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

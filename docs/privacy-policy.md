title: Hanzi Stroke Order – Privacy Policy
updated: 2025-12-02
---

Hanzi Stroke Order (“the App”) is a fully offline learning tool published by Bishun Studio. This document explains what information we collect, how it is stored, and how you can control it.

## 1. Data We Collect

| Category | Details | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Character resources | Local JSON stroke data bundled inside the APK. | Assets only; not user data. |
| Practice history | Current character, streak counts, error stats needed to resume a session. | Stored locally using Android DataStore; never uploaded. |
| Settings | Board options (grid, stroke color, template visibility), analytics toggles. | Stored locally via DataStore. |
| Crash/feedback logs *(optional)* | If you explicitly choose “Send Feedback”, we include a plain-text log to help debug issues. | Temporarily written to app-private storage; shared only through your chosen email client. |

We do **not** collect names, email addresses, precise location, contacts, or advertising identifiers. The App does not use third-party analytics SDKs.

## 2. How Data Is Used

- Resume your latest character/course session.
- Display learning statistics inside the profile dialog.
- Remember board and demo preferences.
- Investigate bugs only when you manually share feedback logs.

No information leaves your device unless you explicitly export it (for example, by emailing feedback).

## 3. Permissions

| Permission | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` *(optional)* | Reserved for future course updates and to let you open external dictionary links. The App does not contact remote servers today. |

You can use the App offline. Disabling network access will not degrade functionality.

## 4. Your Controls

- **Reset data**: Clear the app storage from Android Settings → Apps → Hanzi Stroke Order → Storage → Clear data.
- **Opt-out switches**: From the profile avatar menu → Privacy, toggle analytics/crash reporting (these stay disabled by default until implemented).
- **Feedback logs**: Before sending, you can preview and edit the log text.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The App targets general audiences, including students. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. Parents can clear practice data at any time via system settings.

## 6. Changes

If we add cloud sync, accounts, or online services, we will update this policy, bump the `updated` date, and highlight the changes inside the in-app Privacy screen.

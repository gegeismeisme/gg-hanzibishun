updated: 2025-12-25

Hanzi Stroke Order (the "App") is an offline-first learning tool published by Bishun Studio. This document explains what information is processed, how it is stored, and how you can control it.

## 1. Data We Collect / Process

| Category | Details | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Character resources | Local JSON stroke data bundled inside the APK. | Assets only; not user data. |
| Practice history | Characters practiced, stroke progress, and history needed to resume. | Stored locally using Android DataStore; never uploaded. |
| Settings | Board options (grid, stroke color, template visibility), language override. | Stored locally via DataStore. |
| Crash/feedback logs *(optional)* | If you explicitly choose "Send Feedback" we include a plain-text log to help debug issues. | Stored temporarily in app-private storage; shared only through your chosen email/share app. |
| Advertising *(optional)* | If ads are enabled, Google Mobile Ads SDK may process device identifiers (such as the Advertising ID), coarse location derived from IP, and ad interaction events. | Processed by Google; not stored on our servers. |

We do **not** collect names, contacts, or precise location.

## 2. How Data Is Used

- Resume your latest character/course session.
- Display learning statistics and practice history on your device.
- Remember board and demo preferences.
- Investigate bugs only when you manually share feedback logs.
- Show banner ads to support a free app.

No information leaves your device unless you explicitly export it (for example, by emailing/sharing feedback).

## 3. Permissions

| Permission | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` | Required to load ads (if enabled) and reserved for future updates/external links. The core learning features work offline. |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | Used by the ads SDK to determine connectivity. |

## 4. Your Controls

- **Reset data**: Clear the app storage from Android Settings → Apps → Hanzi Stroke Order → Storage → Clear data.
- **Feedback logs**: Before sending, you can preview and edit the log text.

## 5. Children's Privacy

The App targets general audiences, including students. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. Parents can clear practice data at any time via system settings.

## 6. Changes

If we add cloud sync, accounts, or online services, we will update this policy, bump the `updated` date, and highlight the changes inside the in-app Privacy screen.

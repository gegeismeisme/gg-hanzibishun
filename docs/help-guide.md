title: Hanzi Stroke Order – Help & Onboarding
updated: 2025-12-02
---

## Quick Start

1. **Pick a character**  
   Enter a single Hanzi in the compact input box → tap the cloud icon to load its offline data.
2. **Watch the demo**  
   Use the play or loop icons in the top action row. If the calligraphy overlay is enabled, the demo will render with template strokes.
3. **Practice**  
   Tap the pencil icon on the board to start. Follow each highlighted stroke order; use the lightbulb icon for hints.
4. **Toggle guides**  
   From the board settings column choose grid type (none / 米字 / 九宫) and stroke color. Templates can be switched off to focus on freehand writing.

## Course Flow

- The avatar menu → “Courses” lets you launch HSK-style levels.  
- A compact progress chip stays above the board showing `completed/total` strokes plus resume/skip/restart/exit icons.  
- Use the chevrons beside the board to jump between symbols. When a course is inactive, the chip reverts to motivational text.

## Dictionary Card

Tap the square area next to the large Kaishu glyph to expand the word card. It shows:
- **Pinyin & radicals**
- **Explanation/meaning** (scrollable dialog)
- **HSK badge** when available
- **Speaker icon** (TextToSpeech) to play pronunciation offline

## Gestures & Controls

| Action | Gesture |
| --- | --- |
| Draw stroke | Single finger drag inside the board. |
| Cancel stroke | Lift finger before crossing the expected endpoint; the stroke resets automatically. |
| Pan UI | Boards are fixed to avoid accidental scroll; vertical scroll happens outside the canvas. |

## Troubleshooting

- **No animation after tapping Play** – Ensure a character is loaded; demos auto-load the last query.  
- **Template not visible** – Check the settings column; enable “楷书描红”.  
- **Resource missing** – Confirm the bundled data contains the character (stored in `assets/characters`). Add missing JSON via future updates.
